  <h1>Hi! I'm Jenny Wang.</h1>
  <h5>I am a senior in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Applications. In the future, I want to pursue software engineering and artificial intelligence, specifically in fashion; such as wearable technology and sustainable clothing. My interest in fashion peaked when I decided to make a shirt entirely out of my homework (seriously, I know it's pretty random) during my sophomore year of high school. This personal project reminded me of the material engineering unit from my first engineering class and inspired me to seek intersections between art and STEM.</h5>

               Throughout this project, I worked primarily on marketing, research as well as assisting in technical needs. To cater to our audiences, I coded a website explaining the mission of our app. During this project, my teammates and I worked asynchronously from our homes. We scheduled meetings to debrief over our needs and To-Dos. One of my additional responsibilities on this project was to write the script and produce our video to advertise our product. Due to the fact that this was a project that we planned on submitting into the Entrepreneurship Showcase. One of the main challenges of this project was coordination and time management. Once again, due to the virtual nature of the project, as well as the fact that many of my teammates...

               For the past two summers, I have been spending two weeks at the all girls code camp, Kode with Klossy in San Fransisco (and virtually this year) with my fellow classmates and instructors. In 2019, I was exposed to new code languages for website design. I learned how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. At the end of the two weeks, we were each assigned projects to complete and present to the whole class. I met so many amazing girls and my instructors were always patient and understanding. Not only did I learn about different coding languages, but I also learned about the culture of tech itself. I am thankful for the opportunity to discover my passions for code as well as make lasting connections. During those two weeks, we had many guest speakers come in and talk to us about their experiences in technology as females. After the camp, I feel more confident about my skills in computer science and so excited to learn more...
