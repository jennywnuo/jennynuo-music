      <h1 style= "padding-top:20px;">üëãüèª Hi! My name is Jenny Wang </h1>
      <div class="row"> 
      <div class="col-md-8">
         <p>I am a freshman at UCLA studying Linguistics and Computer Science! To me, coding is about creativity ‚Äî and I love exploring the bridge between computer science and the arts, including (but not limited to): language, music, and human interaction. I am extremely passionate about diversity and inclusion in STEM, and I firmly believe that technology should be used to empower and uplift the communities we live in.</p>
         <p>I‚Äôve worked in web development, mobile app development, UI/UX design, and robotics. Some of the languages I've used include: HTML/CSS/JS, Java, Python and Swift. I am so excited to explore all the possibilities that computer science entail! Throughout high school, I participated in the Engineering and Design Academy, taking Project Lead the Way classes like Principles of Engineering and AP Computer Science. There, I discovered my love for problem solving and coding through building simulations and mechanisms.</p>
         <p>Please feel free to reach out <a style="color: #ed8597; font-weight:500;" href="#contact">here</a>!</p>

      <h1 style= "padding-top: 20px;">üìå Here are some things I've been a part of:</h1>
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bruinwalk.com/">Full Stack Developer @ The Daily Bruin (2021)</a></h3>
      <p>Bruinwalk, under the Daily Bruin, serves over 18k students of the UCLA community yearly. This site allows students to find next classes, share reviews of courses and apartments with others, and much more.</p>
      <p>Throughout the summer, I worked closesly with 5 other interns to push out a fully-fledged redesign of the website. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript and worked mainly on frontend engineering; fixing bugs on the search results page and implementing a more responsive design to fit mobile screens.</p>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Scholar and Instructor Assistant @ Kode with Klossy (2019-2021)</a></h3>
      <p>‚Äã‚ÄãI attended a two-week summer program dedicated to educating and empowering young women and non-binary students in STEM, where I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a fully functional website promoting sustainable fashion (2019) and Swift to develop a productivity-enhancing mobile app centered around creativity and mental health (2020).</p>
      <p>As a Mobile App Development instructor assistant, I personally taught over 30 scholars the fundamentals of Swift and Xcode. By the end of our two-week session, scholars were able to create minimum viable products of their applications. In addition to teaching technicals, I also promoted equity in STEM by leading multiple Culture of Technology discussions where we covered topics like race, gender and inclusivity.</p>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://gaelforcerobotics.github.io/index.html">Desginer and Builder @ VEX Robotics Team 5327C (2019-2021)</a></h3>
      <p>With a team of 10 students, I helped design and build a robot to compete in international tournaments. We have won 4 Design Awards, 1 Innovate Award, 1 Excellence Award, and a Tournament Champion Award at VEX competitions. Additionally, our team placed first in the world in the VEX 2021 Electronics Online Challenge, in which we disassembled a handheld radio. This allowed us to qualify for the 2021 VEX World Championship.</p>
      <p>As a designer, I worked on the robotics engineering notebook, documenting the design, construction, iteration and completion of the robot. On the software side, we use a C-based language to program our team‚Äôs robot.</p>

      <h1 style="padding-top: 20px;">üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Here are some things I've worked on:</h1>
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jennywnuo.com">Jenny Nuo Artist Website (2020-2021)</a></h3>
      <p>Jenny Nuo is my online alias for my indie-pop music career. Through my platform, I combine my passion for both music and STEM with songs like print(‚Äúi‚Äôm so tired‚Äù) [about my experiences as a minority in STEM] and valedictorian (about feeings of insecurity and imposter syndrome).</p>
      <p>As an independent artist with no team, I am essentially in charge of everything: marketing, promotion, playlisting etc. ‚Äî this includes building my official website. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to design and create the site.</p>

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://jennywnuo.github.io/aslsignin/Entrepreneurship-Website/index.html">Sign-In ASL Translator App (2020)</a></h3>
      <p>Sign-In is an application that uses machine learning to convert visual sign language cues to text using a phone or tablet camera. The purpose of our visual language translation app is to make communication with the Deaf community easier when one person does not know sign language and it is inefficient to translate. This project was entered in Dublin High School‚Äôs 2020 Entrepreneurship Competition and it won first place.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project, I worked as the front-end developer, creating a website explaining the mission of our app with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Additionally, I worked in research, marketing, as well as assisting back-end needs.  We focused on using open source code and numerous TensorFlow and Google Colab image recognition tutorials to create a Python program that recognizes stationary sign language cues.</p>
