             <p>My name is Jenny and I am a senior in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Applications. In the future, I want to pursue software engineering and artificial intelligence, specifically in fashion; such as wearable technology and sustainable clothing. My interest in fashion peaked when I decided to make a shirt entirely out of my homework during my junior year of high school. This personal project reminded me of the material engineering unit from my first engineering class and inspired me to seek intersections between art and STEM. </p> 
             <p>Throughout high school, I have been trying to bridge the intersections between art, music and STEM. Through my first Project Lead the Way class, Principles of Engineering, I discovered my love for building mechanisms and using code to create simulations that demonstrated how these mechanisms worked. Over the summers of 2019 and 2020, I’ve attended two Kode with Klossy camp sessions, one for web development, where I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, and one for mobile app development, where I learned to program in Swift. After my eye-opening experience at Kode with Klossy, I decided to join the Gael Force Robotics Club at my school to build new skills and learn in a different environment.</p>
             <p>Some traits and characteristics that I possess that are related to this career in computer science include creativity, self-motivation and responsibility. Ever since I was a child, I have been invested in visual and performing arts, especially drawing, painting, as well as digital art. My original poster and song titled "Restart" won the Grand Prize at the Alameda County Youth Advisory Board Public Service Announcement Contest. I am self-motivated to perform well in all my classes, and I am constantly challenging myself to </p>

        <p>do my best. This year, I am taking some of my hardest classes, such as AP Computer Science Applications, AP English Literature, AP Government, AP Calculus AB and AP Microeconomics. These classes challenge me to organize my daily schedule and teach me to balance my workload. On top of academics, I am also a member of the Robotics Club, Freshman Mentorship Program in which I work on the Executive Board, and the Engineering Mentorship Program. </p>

        <p>This year, I learned to make time for my own passions and hobbies, while also staying on top of my schoolwork. The reason I chose to take on all these activities is because I am genuinely passionate about them, but I also make sure to have time for all my hobbies. In my freshman year, I was an avid member of my high school show choir and I was accepted into the California All State Honor Choir. In my sophomore year, I became a member of the Las Positas Chamber Choir and I sang in the Capitol Choral Festival. My experiences from choir are reflected in the role I take on in group projects at school because being in choir has taught me about responsibility and leadership. One thing my director has always emphasized is the importance of creating one single voice with multiple voices and I try to emulate this quality of teamwork in every single project that I am a part of. I am responsible because during group projects, I always contribute to the group and do my part while also checking up on the rest of our group to make sure we are not behind on anything. As a member of the Alameda Youth Advisory Board for Tobacco Prevention, I work with fellow board members to organize workshops and conferences, plan for our annual public service announcement contest, and relate our work to the health curriculum at school. One of my proudest projects was organizing the annual Teens ​Tackle Tobacco conference at UC Berkeley. As one of the coordinators, my responsibilities included managing the different workshops and attendance, writing and delivering the opening speech, arranging my very own musical performance and finally holding my own workshop on the side.</p> 
        <p>Throughout shelter in place, I have been furthering my skills in the realm of computer science as well as art and music! In the midst of these strange times, I personally believe that we should take advantage of the benefits of staying at home. Through the Amazon Future Engineer program, I am learning how to code and remix music using Python. In this era, I definitely believe that it is an opportunity for the expansion of creativity due to the fact that there is such a massive captive audience. With the abundance of time, I have been inspired to work on my music and I have been writing songs about just about anything!</p>
